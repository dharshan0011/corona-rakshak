                    <li>First call your doctor or pediatrician for advice</li>
                    <li>If you do not have a doctor and you are concerned that you or your child may have COVID-19, contact your local board of health. They can direct you to the best place for evaluation and treatment in your area</li>
                    <li>It's best to not seek medical care in an emergency department unless you have symptoms of severe illness. Severe symptoms include high or very low body temperature, shortness of breath, confusion, or feeling you might pass out. Call the emergency department ahead of time to let the staff know that you are coming, so they can be prepared for your arrival</li>
                    <li>Mintain social distancing</li>
                    <li>Try to isolate yourself from others in such a way that nobody should come in your contact</li>
                    <li>Get more accurate information about COVID-19. Some good sources include the <a href="https://www.mohfw.gov.in/">Ministry of Health and Family Welfare</a> and <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">WHO</a></li>
